------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.8.11
------------------------------------------------------

- /dumphandlers now includes NBT handlers

------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.8.10
------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed NBT serialization
- Temporarily disabled the capability handlers
    - These were using too much data on the network when looking at large inventories.
    - They will make a return once I can re-implement them in a way that avoids that

------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.8.9
------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed server disconnect when receiving large NBT payloads from TileEntities
    - Only caused when a payload was >2mb in size (which is really, really big for a packet, to be honest...)
    - Most notably occurred was when looking at a RefinedStorage Disk Drive on a large network

------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.8.8
------------------------------------------------------

    - See `CHANGES.md` for more information
- Add an alternative way to get a crop's item

------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.8.6
------------------------------------------------------

- Lowercased modid in mcmod.info. The file will work properly now.
- Moved over to a proper proxy system instead of the possibly buggy side checks.
- In-game config now properly respects localization keys.
- Added a fallback for when blocks return null in `getPickBlock(...)`
    - This is a big no-no in 1.11. If you notice this (trust me, you will), please report it to the author of the mod.

Version 1.8.5
------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed some remaining invalid null stack checks

------------------------------------------------------
